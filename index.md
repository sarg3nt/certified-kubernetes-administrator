# CKA Training Notes Scope

These notes were created by David Sargent when I went through the Udemy course [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) with Practice Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests) by Mumshad Mannambeth.

These notes are not a substitute for taking the above course, although it may look like I took fairly detailed notes there are several sections, especially early on, that are sparse or non-existent as I knew that material really well already.

If you see mistakes or would like to clean things up, feel free to do so and create a PR.

# Cliff Notes

The [Cliff Notes](./Cliff%20Notes) file located at the root of this repo contains my condensed notes of items I needed to memorize for the test, so it probably does not contain everything you need to learn.
